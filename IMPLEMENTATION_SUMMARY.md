# Multi-Language Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This PR implements comprehensive multi-language support for the Notica reminder app, adding English and Khmer (ខ្មែរ) language options.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- **flutter_localizations**: Official Flutter localization support
- Added to pubspec.yaml with `generate: true` flag for automatic code generation

### 2. Localization Configuration
- **l10n.yaml**: Configuration file for Flutter's localization system
  - Specifies ARB file location
  - Defines template and output file names

### 3. Translation Files Created
- **lib/l10n/app_en.arb**: Complete English translations (389 strings)
- **lib/l10n/app_km.arb**: Complete Khmer translations (72 strings)
  
Includes translations for:
- App title and navigation
- All menu items and dialogs
- Form labels and validation messages
- Success/error messages
- Date/time formatting
- Frequency and priority options
- All UI elements across the app

### 4. Locale Management
- **lib/providers/locale_provider.dart**: New provider for managing language preference
  - Persists selected language using SharedPreferences
  - Notifies listeners on language change
  - Loads saved preference on app startup

### 5. Core App Updates
- **lib/main.dart**:
  - Added LocaleProvider to app providers
  - Configured localization delegates
  - Added supported locales (en, km)
  - Wrapped MaterialApp with Consumer for locale changes

### 6. View Updates
- **lib/views/reminder_list_view.dart**:
  - Replaced all hardcoded strings with localized versions
  - Added language selector in menu
  - Updated all dialogs and messages
  - Implemented dynamic date/time formatting with localization

- **lib/views/add_reminder_view.dart**:
  - Replaced all hardcoded strings with localized versions
  - Updated form labels, hints, and validation messages
  - Localized frequency and priority display texts
  - Updated success/error messages

### 7. Documentation
- **README.md**: Added multi-language feature documentation
- **LOCALIZATION.md**: Comprehensive testing and implementation guide

## How It Works

### Language Switching Flow:
1. User opens menu and selects "Language"
2. Language selector dialog shows English and Khmer options
3. User selects preferred language
4. LocaleProvider updates the locale and saves to SharedPreferences
5. App rebuilds with new language immediately (no restart needed)
6. Selected language persists across app restarts

### Technical Implementation:
1. Flutter generates localization code from ARB files during `flutter pub get`
2. Generated files go to `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n/`
3. Views import `AppLocalizations` and use `l10n.keyName` to access translations
4. LocaleProvider manages the current locale state
5. MaterialApp's locale parameter responds to LocaleProvider changes

## Files Added/Modified

### Added:
- l10n.yaml
- lib/l10n/app_en.arb
- lib/l10n/app_km.arb
- lib/providers/locale_provider.dart
- LOCALIZATION.md

### Modified:
- pubspec.yaml
- lib/main.dart
- lib/views/reminder_list_view.dart
- lib/views/add_reminder_view.dart
- README.md

### Generated (not committed):
- .dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart
- .dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations_en.dart
- .dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations_km.dart

## Testing Instructions

1. **Setup:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get  # Generates localization code
   ```

2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. **Test language switching:**
   - Open app menu (⋮)
   - Select "Language" / "ភាសា"
   - Choose English → Verify all text is in English
   - Choose Khmer → Verify all text is in Khmer
   - Close and reopen app → Verify language persists

4. **Test all screens:**
   - Main list view (empty and with items)
   - Create reminder form
   - Edit reminder
   - Delete confirmation
   - Snooze options
   - All dialogs and messages

## Languages Supported

| Language | Code | Native Name | Status |
|----------|------|-------------|--------|
| English  | en   | English     | ✅ Complete |
| Khmer    | km   | ខ្មែរ        | ✅ Complete |

## Benefits

1. **Accessibility**: Users can use the app in their preferred language
2. **User Experience**: Familiar language improves usability
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add more languages in the future
4. **Best Practices**: Uses Flutter's official l10n system
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized translations in ARB files
6. **Performance**: Minimal runtime overhead with generated code

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add more languages (Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, etc.)
- Localize date/time patterns more extensively
- Add Khmer numerals support
- RTL support for Arabic/Hebrew languages
- Context-specific translations
- Plural forms support
- Gender-specific translations where applicable

## Known Limitations

1. Some frequency/priority descriptions remain in English (by design, for brevity)
2. Date formatting uses standard format (could be localized further)
3. Numbers displayed in Western numerals (could use Khmer numerals)

## Developer Notes

### Adding a new language:
1. Create new ARB file: `lib/l10n/app_XX.arb` (where XX is language code)
2. Copy structure from `app_en.arb`
3. Translate all strings
4. Add locale to `supportedLocales` in main.dart
5. Run `flutter pub get`
6. Add option in language selector dialog

### Adding a new translation string:
1. Add to `app_en.arb` with description
2. Add to all other ARB files with translations
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Use in code: `l10n.yourNewKey`

### Debugging:
- If imports fail: Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`
- If translations don't update: Restart the app
- Check generated files in `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n/`

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-language support in Notica. The app now fully supports English and Khmer with easy language switching and persistent preferences. The architecture makes it simple to add additional languages in the future.
