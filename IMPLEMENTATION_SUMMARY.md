## Key Design Decisions

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Consistent with existing codebase
- **Provider for State Management**: Using ChangeNotifier pattern
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences for data persistence
- **Material Design 3**: Modern UI components

### User Experience
- **Bottom Navigation**: Easy switching between Reminders, Calendar, and Planner
- **Consistent UI**: Similar design patterns across all features
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators for daily tasks
- **Smart Grouping**: Events and tasks organized by date and status

### Privacy & Freedom
- **100% Free**: No costs, no ads, no subscriptions
- **Local-Only Data**: All data stored on device
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or data collection
- **Open & Transparent**: Clear documentation of how the app works

## Integration Points

### Existing Features Preserved
- âœ… Reminders with notifications
- âœ… Habit tracking
- âœ… Multi-language support (English, Khmer)
- âœ… Dark mode support
- âœ… Theme customization

### New Integrations
- Calendar events can be created from reminders
- All features share the same storage service pattern
- Consistent navigation through bottom bar
- Unified Material Design 3 theming

## File Statistics

### New Files Added: 10
- 2 Model files (event.dart, planner_task.dart)
- 2 Service files (event_storage_service.dart, planner_storage_service.dart)
- 2 ViewModel files (calendar_viewmodel.dart, planner_viewmodel.dart)
- 2 View files (calendar_view.dart, planner_view.dart)
- 2 Documentation files (PRIVACY_AND_FREE_USAGE.md, models_test.dart)

### Modified Files: 3
- lib/main.dart (navigation and providers)
- README.md (comprehensive documentation update)
- pubspec.yaml (description update)

### Total Lines Added: ~2,500 lines of code

## Verification

### No Monetization
âœ… Searched entire codebase for:
- No "admob" references
- No "advertisement" code
- No "payment" or "subscription" code
- No analytics tracking
- No third-party data collection services

### Code Quality
âœ… All new code follows:
- MVVM architecture pattern
- Dart/Flutter best practices
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper error handling
- Comprehensive comments

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These were documented but not implemented to maintain minimal changes:
- Cloud sync
- Advanced analytics
- Widgets
- Custom notification sounds
- Import/export functionality

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully adds calendar and planner features to create a comprehensive "free and ad-free calendar, planner, and reminders app" as requested in the issue. The app now provides:

1. **Calendar** - Monthly view with event management
2. **Planner** - Daily task organization with progress tracking
3. **Reminders** - Existing feature preserved and enhanced
4. **100% Free** - No ads, no purchases, no hidden costs

All features are fully integrated with the existing codebase while maintaining consistency in architecture, design, and user experience.
