# Privacy and Free Usage Statement

## 100% Free and Ad-Free

Notica is designed to be a **completely free** and **ad-free** productivity application. We believe in providing a distraction-free experience without any hidden costs or advertisements.

### What This Means:

- ✅ **No Advertisements**: The app contains zero ads, banners, or promotional content
- ✅ **No In-App Purchases**: All features are available to all users at no cost
- ✅ **No Subscriptions**: There are no subscription models or premium tiers
- ✅ **No Hidden Costs**: You will never be asked to pay for anything
- ✅ **No Data Collection for Ads**: We don't collect data to serve advertisements
- ✅ **Offline-First**: All data is stored locally on your device

### Privacy-Focused

- **Local Storage**: All your reminders, events, and tasks are stored locally using SharedPreferences
- **No Cloud Sync** (Currently): Your data stays on your device
- **No Analytics Tracking**: We don't track your usage or send data to third parties
- **No Account Required**: Start using the app immediately without signing up

### Open Development

This is an open-source project focused on helping users stay organized without distractions or hidden costs. The app prioritizes:

1. **Simplicity**: Easy to use interface without clutter
2. **Reliability**: Stable performance with local storage
3. **User Privacy**: Your data remains private on your device
4. **Transparency**: Open about how the app works and what it does

### Future Considerations

If cloud sync or additional features requiring backend services are added in the future:

- They will be **optional** features
- The app will remain **free**
- There will be **no advertisements**
- Privacy and user control will remain priorities
