## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **lib/views/planner_view.dart**
   - Added search, filter, and edit dialogs
   - Implemented active filters card
   - Added task detail view
   - Enhanced task card with edit option
   - Added overdue tasks dialog
   - ~656 lines of new code

2. **test/models_test.dart**
   - Added tests for task copyWith functionality
   - Added tests for priority and status colors
   - ~67 new lines

3. **test/planner_viewmodel_test.dart** (New File)
   - Comprehensive ViewModel test suite
   - Tests for all CRUD operations
   - Filter and search validation
   - ~200 lines of test code

### State Management

New state variables added to `_PlannerViewState`:
```dart
TaskPriority? _filterPriority;  // Current priority filter
TaskStatus? _filterStatus;      // Current status filter
String _searchQuery = '';        // Current search query
```

### UI Components

New methods added:
- `_showSearchDialog()` - Search dialog with text input
- `_showFilterDialog()` - Filter selection with chips
- `_showEditTaskDialog()` - Task editing form
- `_showTaskDetailsDialog()` - Task detail viewer
- `_showOverdueTasksDialog()` - Overdue tasks manager
- `_buildActiveFiltersCard()` - Active filters display
- `_buildDetailRow()` - Helper for detail view rows

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Consistent Iconography**: All dialogs use appropriate icons for quick recognition
2. **Color Coding**: Priority and status use consistent colors throughout
3. **Visual Feedback**: Active filters shown with filled icon and display card
4. **Quick Actions**: Most common actions accessible with single tap
5. **Smart Defaults**: Time picker initializes to current time when adding new
6. **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no tasks match filters
7. **Accessibility**: All interactive elements have proper touch targets

## Testing Coverage

### Model Tests
- Task creation and serialization
- copyWith functionality
- Priority and status color mapping
- Overdue detection
- Completion status

### ViewModel Tests
- Task CRUD operations
- Task completion toggling
- Date-based filtering
- Priority-based filtering
- Status-based filtering
- Overdue task detection
- Completion percentage calculation
- Input validation
- Edge cases (empty strings, trimming)

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

While not implemented in this PR, these could be future additions:
- Multi-select for bulk operations
- Task sorting options (by priority, time, alphabetical)
- Quick filters toolbar (Today, This Week, High Priority)
- Task templates for recurring task patterns
- Drag and drop to reorder or reschedule tasks
- Task notes/comments feature
- File attachments
- Subtasks/checklists within tasks
- Task dependencies
- Calendar integration for synchronized scheduling

## Backward Compatibility

All enhancements are additive and maintain full backward compatibility:
- Existing tasks load without modification
- No changes to data model structure
- Storage format unchanged
- All existing features continue to work

## Performance Considerations

- Filtering operations are O(n) and performed locally
- Search is case-insensitive but efficient for typical task lists
- No additional network calls or storage operations
- UI updates use Flutter's efficient rebuilding

## Conclusion

These enhancements transform the Daily Planner from a basic task list into a powerful task management tool while maintaining the app's simplicity and ease of use. All changes follow Flutter best practices and the app's existing MVVM architecture pattern.
